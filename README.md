_2nd year - Design and Analysis of Algorithm (DAA) practicals  (As per the University of Delhi B.Sc. (Hons) Computer Science syllabus)_

1. Programs are named after the Practical No. into the Syllabus guidelines.
2. Please check practicalList.pdf to browse the list of practicals as per the syllabus guidelines.The link is given below  

## Practical List  
1. Implement following sort algos.:  
> i. Insertion Sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)  
> ii. Merge Sort(The program should report the number of comparisons)  
2. Implement Heap Sort(The program should report the number of comparisons)  
3. Implement Randomized Quick sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)  
4. Implement Radix Sort  
5. Create a Red-Black Tree and perform following operations on it:  
> i. Insert a node  
> ii. Delete a nodeiii.Search for a number & also report the color of the node containing this number.  

6. Write a program to determine the LCS of two given sequences  
7. Implement Breadth-First Search in a graph  
8. Implement Depth-First Search in a graph  
9. Write a program  to determine the minimum spanning tree of a graph For the algorithms at S.No 1 to 3 test run the algorithm on 100 different inputs of sizes varying from 30 to 1000. Count the number of comparisons and draw the graph. Compare it with a graph of nlogn.
